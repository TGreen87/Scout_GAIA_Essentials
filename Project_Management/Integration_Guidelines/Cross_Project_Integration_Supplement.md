   - Classify dependencies by type and criticality

2. **Create Dependency Matrix**

   | Component | Dependencies From | Dependencies To | Type | Criticality | Integration Approach |
   |-----------|-------------------|-----------------|------|-------------|----------------------|
   | HR System Interface | Neurodivergent Design Principles | Demo Environment | Technical | High | Maintain core principles while integrating |
   | Content Marketing Strategy | Brand Guidelines | Lead Generation System | Content | Medium | Harmonize messaging while preserving unique elements |
   | Australian Compliance Framework | None | HR System Features | Business Logic | High | Preserve completely, may enhance with additions |
   | Launch Timeline | Marketing Materials Completion | None | Timeline | High | Align with other project timelines or maintain priority |

3. **Resolve Dependency Conflicts**

   When dependencies conflict between projects, use this resolution framework:

   - **Evaluate Maturity**: Which implementation is more mature or complete?
   - **Assess Quality**: Which implementation has higher quality or better design?
   - **Consider Uniqueness**: Which implementation contains unique capabilities that should be preserved?
   - **Check Alignment**: Which implementation better aligns with the merged business vision?
   - **Review Maintainability**: Which implementation is easier to maintain or expand?
