## Critical Dependencies

Understanding the critical dependencies in the Green AI Solutions project is essential for successful integration. These dependencies represent core elements that other components rely on and must be preserved during integration.

### Core System Dependencies

| Dependency | Description | Dependent Components | Integration Approach |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Australian Compliance Framework** | The foundational framework ensuring all HR components meet Australian regulatory requirements | HR systems, policy generators, compliance dashboards, content marketing | Preserve in its entirety; other integrated components must conform to compliance standards |
| **Neurodivergent Design System** | Design principles and components that enable neurodivergent-friendly interfaces | UI components, user flows, information architecture, help documentation | Maintain core principles; extend to integrate with other design elements |
| **Knowledge Transfer Methodology** | Approach to client enablement that builds capability rather than dependency | Service delivery, documentation, client interactions, support materials | Preserve methodology; apply to other service components |
| **Modular Architecture** | System design that enables components to be implemented incrementally | System implementation, pricing strategy, client onboarding, technical architecture | Maintain modular approach; ensure new integrated components follow same principles |

### Dependency Preservation Strategy

To maintain the integrity of critical dependencies during integration:

1. **Document All Dependencies**
   - Create comprehensive dependency maps for both projects
   - Identify intersections and potential conflicts
   - Document dependency direction and criticality

2. **Establish Dependency Hierarchy**
   - Australian Compliance Framework is highest priority - all other components must conform
   - Neurodivergent Design principles must be maintained for all user interfaces
   - Knowledge Transfer approach must be preserved in all client interactions
   - Modular architecture must be maintained for system flexibility

3. **Integration Testing Protocol**
   - Create specific tests to verify dependency preservation
   - Test integrated components against dependency requirements
   - Document any compromises or adaptations necessary

4. **Dependency Documentation**
   - Update all technical documentation to reflect dependency relationships
   - Create clear guidelines for maintaining dependencies in future development
   - Ensure all team members understand critical dependencies
