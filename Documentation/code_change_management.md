# Code Change Management

## Overview

This guide establishes procedures for managing code changes within the Green AI Solutions project. It provides guidelines for developers to ensure consistent, traceable, and high-quality code changes across all repositories.

## Core Principles

1. **All changes are tracked**: Every code change must be tracked through version control
2. **All changes are reviewed**: No code enters production without peer review
3. **All changes are tested**: Automated and manual testing for every change
4. **All changes are documented**: Clear documentation of what changed and why
5. **All changes are reversible**: Ability to roll back to previous states

## Change Types

Code changes are categorized into these types:

### 1. Feature Development

- New functionality or significant enhancement
- Requires comprehensive testing and documentation
- Typically developed in a feature branch
- Requires full review before merging

### 2. Bug Fixes

- Corrections to existing functionality
- Requires targeted testing focused on the fix
- Developed in a bugfix branch
- Requires verification that the bug is resolved

### 3. Refactoring

- Code improvements without changing functionality
- Requires regression testing to ensure no functionality changes
- May be developed in a refactor branch
- Requires careful review for potential impacts

### 4. Performance Improvements

- Optimizations to existing functionality
- Requires performance benchmarking
- Developed in a performance branch
- Requires validation of actual improvement

### 5. Security Updates

- Addressing security vulnerabilities
- Requires security testing and validation
- Typically high priority with expedited process
- May require confidential handling

## Change Management Workflow

### 1. Change Planning

Before making code changes:

1. **Create an issue/ticket** describing the proposed change
2. **Assess impact** on other components and dependencies
3. **Determine scope** of the change (estimate complexity)
4. **Plan testing approach** appropriate to the change
5. **Assign appropriate priority** and add to sprint/backlog

### 2. Development Process

When implementing changes:

1. **Create a new branch** from the latest develop branch
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   ```

2. **Make incremental commits** with descriptive messages
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: Implement user profile API endpoint"
   ```

3. **Follow coding standards** defined in the code style guide
4. **Write/update tests** covering the changes
5. **Update documentation** affected by the changes
6. **Regularly rebase/merge** from develop to prevent conflicts
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull
   git checkout feature/my-new-feature
   git rebase develop
   ```

### 3. Code Review Process

When submitting changes for review:

1. **Push your branch** to the remote repository
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-new-feature
   ```

2. **Create a pull request** with detailed description
3. **Link the associated issue/ticket** in the pull request
4. **Request reviews** from appropriate team members
5. **Address review feedback** promptly and thoroughly
6. **Ensure all CI checks pass** before merging

### 4. Testing Requirements

Before approving changes:

1. **Unit tests** cover new functionality and edge cases
2. **Integration tests** verify interaction with other components
3. **End-to-end tests** for user-facing changes
4. **Performance tests** for changes that may affect performance
5. **Security scanning** for code vulnerabilities
6. **Manual testing** for complex user interfaces

### 5. Merging Process

When merging approved changes:

1. **Ensure all reviews are complete** and approved
2. **Verify all tests pass** on the latest version
3. **Resolve any merge conflicts** that arise
4. **Consider squashing commits** for cleaner history (optional)
5. **Merge the pull request** into the target branch
6. **Delete the feature branch** after successful merge

### 6. Release Management

When preparing for release:

1. **Create a release branch** from develop
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git checkout -b release/v1.0.0
   ```

2. **Perform final testing** on the release branch
3. **Fix critical issues** discovered during testing
4. **Update version numbers** in relevant files
5. **Merge to main/master** when ready for production
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge release/v1.0.0
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
   git push origin main --tags
   ```

6. **Merge back to develop** to retain any release fixes
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git merge release/v1.0.0
   git push origin develop
   ```

## Branch Management

### Branch Naming Conventions

- **feature/[feature-name]**: New features or enhancements
- **bugfix/[bug-description]**: Bug fixes
- **hotfix/[issue-description]**: Critical production fixes
- **refactor/[component]**: Code refactoring
- **performance/[component]**: Performance improvements
- **docs/[description]**: Documentation updates
- **test/[description]**: Test improvements
- **release/[version]**: Release preparation

### Branch Lifetime

- **Feature branches**: Typically 1-2 weeks (one sprint)
- **Bugfix branches**: 1-3 days
- **Hotfix branches**: Less than 1 day
- **Release branches**: 1-2 days

## Commit Standards

### Commit Message Format

Follow the Conventional Commits specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Where `type` is one of:
- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes
- **refactor**: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Build process or auxiliary tool changes

Examples:
```
feat(auth): Add multi-factor authentication
fix(dashboard): Correct data calculation in summary widget
docs(api): Update endpoint documentation
```

### Commit Best Practices

1. **Commit focused changes**: Each commit should address a single concern
2. **Write clear messages**: Describe what and why, not how
3. **Keep commits small**: Easier to review and understand
4. **Reference issue numbers**: Include ticket/issue IDs where applicable
5. **Separate refactoring from feature changes**: Makes review easier

## Code Review Guidelines

### For Authors

1. **Self-review before submission**: Check your own code first
2. **Write clear PR descriptions**: Explain purpose, approach, and testing
3. **Keep changes focused**: Don't mix unrelated changes
4. **Respond to feedback constructively**: Be open to suggestions
5. **Update PR based on feedback**: Address all review comments

### For Reviewers

1. **Be thorough but respectful**: Focus on the code, not the person
2. **Check for standards compliance**: Verify coding standards are followed
3. **Verify test coverage**: Ensure adequate testing is included
4. **Look for security issues**: Identify potential vulnerabilities
5. **Consider edge cases**: Think about potential failure scenarios
6. **Approve only when satisfied**: Don't approve prematurely

## Continuous Integration

### CI Pipeline Requirements

All repositories should have CI pipelines that:

1. **Build the application**: Verify it compiles/builds successfully
2. **Run automated tests**: Execute unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
3. **Check code quality**: Run linters and static analysis
4. **Measure test coverage**: Report on code coverage metrics
5. **Perform security scanning**: Check for known vulnerabilities
6. **Create deployable artifacts**: Package the application for deployment

### CI Status Reporting

CI status should be:
- Visible in the pull request
- Reported to the development team
- Blocking for merges when failures occur
- Documented with clear error messages

## Emergency Change Procedure

For critical production issues:

1. **Create a hotfix branch** from the main/production branch
2. **Implement minimal changes** to address the issue
3. **Get expedited review** from at least one senior developer
4. **Deploy directly to production** after approval
5. **Merge back to develop** to ensure the fix is not lost
6. **Document the emergency change** with full details

## Version Numbering

### Semantic Versioning

Use semantic versioning for application releases:

- **Major version (X.0.0)**: Incompatible API changes or major new functionality
- **Minor version (0.X.0)**: Backward-compatible new features
- **Patch version (0.0.X)**: Backward-compatible bug fixes

### Version in Code

Maintain version information in:

1. **Package files**: Update version in package.json, setup.py, etc.
2. **Documentation**: Update version references in docs
3. **Release notes**: Document changes for each version
4. **Application code**: Make version visible in the application

## Documentation Requirements

### Code Documentation

- **Comments**: Explain why, not what (code should be self-explanatory)
- **API documentation**: Document all public interfaces and endpoints
- **JSDoc/Docstrings**: Use standard formats for function documentation
- **Architecture documentation**: Keep system architecture diagrams updated
- **README files**: Maintain clear instructions for setup and contribution

### Change Documentation

- **CHANGELOG.md**: Maintain a changelog of significant changes
- **Release notes**: Document user-facing changes for each release
- **Migration guides**: Provide instructions for major version upgrades

## Dependency Management

### Adding Dependencies

Before adding new dependencies:

1. **Evaluate necessity**: Consider if it's truly needed
2. **Check license compatibility**: Ensure license is compatible with the project
3. **Assess security**: Verify no known vulnerabilities
4. **Consider maintenance**: Check activity and community support
5. **Evaluate size impact**: Consider bundle size implications
6. **Document the decision**: Record why the dependency was added

### Updating Dependencies

When updating dependencies:

1. **Update regularly**: Schedule regular dependency updates
2. **Test thoroughly**: Verify application works with updated dependencies
3. **Review changelogs**: Understand what changed in the dependency
4. **Update one at a time**: Update and test dependencies individually
5. **Document breaking changes**: Note any required code changes

## Monitoring and Rollback

### Deployment Monitoring

After deploying changes:

1. **Monitor error rates**: Watch for increased errors
2. **Check performance metrics**: Ensure performance doesn't degrade
3. **Monitor user engagement**: Look for changes in user behavior
4. **Watch system resources**: Check for resource utilization changes

### Rollback Procedure

If issues are discovered:

1. **Assess severity**: Determine if immediate rollback is needed
2. **Execute rollback**: Deploy previous known-good version
3. **Notify stakeholders**: Inform team and users about the rollback
4. **Investigate root cause**: Determine what caused the issues
5. **Plan corrective action**: Fix the issues for next deployment
