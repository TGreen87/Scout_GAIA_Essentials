# Document Management Workflow

## Overview

This guide outlines the workflow for creating, updating, reviewing, and maintaining documents within the Green AI Solutions project. Following these procedures ensures that all documentation remains current, accurate, and properly versioned.

## Document Lifecycle

Documents in the Green AI Solutions project follow this lifecycle:

1. **Planning**: Determining the need for a document
2. **Creation**: Writing the initial draft
3. **Review**: Getting feedback from relevant stakeholders
4. **Approval**: Formal approval of the document
5. **Publication**: Making the document available to its intended audience
6. **Maintenance**: Regular updates and revisions
7. **Archiving**: Marking outdated documents as historical references

## Document Statuses

Each document must have one of these status indicators:

- **Draft**: Initial working version, not yet reviewed
- **Review**: Document under review by stakeholders
- **Approved**: Final approved version, ready for use
- **Deprecated**: No longer current, but referenced by active documents
- **Archived**: Historical document preserved for reference only

## Creating New Documents

### Before Creating a Document

1. Check if a similar document already exists
2. Determine the document's purpose and target audience
3. Identify who will review and approve the document
4. Select the appropriate template and category

### Creation Process

1. Create a new file using the [Document Template](document_template.md)
2. Save the file with a name following the [File Naming Conventions](file_naming_conventions.md)
3. Fill in the document metadata section
4. Draft the content, focusing on clarity and completeness
5. Include appropriate references to related documents
6. Set the document status to "Draft"
7. Record the document in the [Document Registry](document_registry.md)

## Reviewing Documents

### Review Process

1. Change the document status to "Review"
2. Update the document registry to reflect the new status
3. Share the document with appropriate reviewers
4. Provide clear instructions and a deadline for feedback
5. Collect and assess all feedback
6. Make necessary revisions
7. Document significant feedback in the change log

### Review Checklist

Reviewers should evaluate documents based on:

- Accuracy of information
- Clarity and readability
- Completeness of content
- Consistency with other documents
- Adherence to document standards
- Appropriate use of terminology

## Approving Documents

### Approval Process

1. After incorporating reviewer feedback, submit the document for approval
2. The designated approver reviews the final version
3. If approved, change the status to "Approved"
4. Update the document registry with the approval date and approver name
5. Add an approval entry to the change log
6. If not approved, return to the review process with additional feedback

### Approval Authority

Document Type | Approval Authority
------------- | ------------------
Executive Documentation | CEO or Project Lead
Business Strategy | Business Strategy Lead
Technical Specifications | Technical Lead
User Documentation | Product Manager
Marketing Materials | Marketing Lead
Internal Processes | Department Manager

## Updating Existing Documents

### Update Types

Updates fall into three categories based on semantic versioning:

1. **Major Updates** (v1.0 → v2.0): Significant content changes or restructuring
2. **Minor Updates** (v1.0 → v1.1): Additions or notable changes to existing content
3. **Patch Updates** (v1.1 → v1.1.1): Small corrections or clarifications

### Update Process

1. Access the most recent version of the document
2. Update the document metadata with new version number and date
3. Make the necessary changes
4. Document the changes in the change log section
5. Set the status to "Review" for significant updates
6. For minor corrections, maintain "Approved" status
7. Update the document registry with the new version information

## Versioning System

### Semantic Versioning

Use semantic versioning (X.Y.Z) where:

- **X** (Major): Significant content changes or restructuring
- **Y** (Minor): Additions or notable changes to existing content
- **Z** (Patch): Small corrections or clarifications

### Version Control Best Practices

1. Never replace an existing version without updating the version number
2. Keep change logs accurate and detailed
3. Include version numbers in document filenames
4. Record all versions in the document registry
5. For code documentation, align versions with code releases

## Deprecating and Archiving Documents

### Deprecation Process

1. Identify documents that are no longer current but may still be referenced
2. Change the status to "Deprecated"
3. Add a deprecation notice at the top of the document
4. Update the document registry to reflect the deprecated status
5. Note what document replaces the deprecated version, if applicable

### Archiving Process

1. Identify documents that are no longer needed for active reference
2. Change the status to "Archived"
3. Add an archival notice at the top of the document
4. Move the document to the Archive directory
5. Update the document registry to reflect the archived status

## Document Registry Management

### Adding to the Registry

When creating a new document:

1. Add a new entry to the appropriate section of the document registry
2. Include all required metadata fields
3. Commit the updated registry along with the new document

### Updating the Registry

When updating a document:

1. Find the document's entry in the registry
2. Update the version, date, and status fields
3. Add any new information about the document's purpose or content
4. Commit the updated registry along with the document changes

## Document Storage and Access

### Storage Locations

- All current documents should be stored in the appropriate repository
- Follow the repository structure defined in [Git Repository Setup](git_repository_setup.md)
- Archive documents in the designated Archive directory

### Access Controls

Document Type | Access Level
------------- | ------------
Public Documentation | All team members and clients
Internal Documentation | All team members
Sensitive Documentation | Restricted to relevant team members
Financial Documentation | Executive team and finance department only

## Templates and Guidelines

To maintain consistency, use these resources:

- [Document Template](document_template.md): Standard template for new documents
- [File Naming Conventions](file_naming_conventions.md): Rules for naming files
- [Version Control Guidelines](version_control_guidelines.md): Detailed version control practices
- [Writing Style Guide](writing_style_guide.md): Guidelines for writing tone and style

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Conflicting Updates

If multiple people update the same document:

1. Compare versions to identify differences
2. Merge changes where possible
3. Consult with all contributors on conflicting changes
4. Create a new version incorporating the resolved conflicts

### Missing Documentation

If documentation is missing for a key area:

1. Add the missing documentation to the project backlog
2. Assign priority based on business impact
3. Identify the appropriate owner for creation
4. Follow the standard creation process

## Audit and Compliance

### Regular Documentation Audits

Conduct quarterly documentation audits:

1. Review the document registry for accuracy
2. Identify documents requiring updates
3. Check for adherence to naming and structure conventions
4. Verify that approval processes are being followed
5. Report audit findings to the project lead

### Compliance Requirements

For documentation related to compliance:

1. Ensure all regulatory requirements are addressed
2. Verify that documents are reviewed by legal when necessary
3. Maintain evidence of review and approval
4. Establish clear update triggers for regulatory changes
